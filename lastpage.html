      <h3> The reson I opened this website is because I really like online shoping. Whanever I shop online I get very frustarated that I have to go to many ifferent websites i like inorder to look for clothes. I always wondered if it is possible to just have one website with all my favorite websites combined on it. I know that many of my friends as well have this issue. I decided to make this website and link all my favorite makeup and clothing websites to it. I hope this helps alot of people while shopping online. It sure did help me! I wanna thank all my fans for reading this. Thank you so much for your time.</h3>
