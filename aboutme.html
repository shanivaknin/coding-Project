       <h3>Hi, my name is Shani Vaknin and I am sixteen years old. I go to Magen David Yeshivah High School, and I am in tenth grade. My school wanted al the students to learn about coding,and that seemed very interestig. When I first started it was very difficult. I didn't understand how to do almost anything and I was very behind. But once i actually started paying alot of attention and asked for help I understood alot more. I'm really glad I got to learn how to do all these things. I would totally recommend this coding programs to people and I think tht every highschool should have a coding program atleast once a year for 2 weeks.   </h3>
